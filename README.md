# PurifyCSS Rails Sample

Run [PurifyCSS](https://github.com/purifycss/purifycss) using grunt ([grunt-purifycss](https://github.com/purifycss/grunt-purifycss) against a rails project's assets. 

## Getting Started
Requires Grunt `~0.4.5`

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

```shell
npm install grunt --save-dev
npm install grunt-purifycss --save-dev
```

In `gruntfile.js`, update html, js, css assets specific to your Rails project.

## Usage

`grunt purifycssmulti`
